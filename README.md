# project-2048

This project was completed in Spring 2018.

Begin the game by running Game2048.java

Game2048.java - This file contains the main game function, draws the board, 
    and contains an animation loop where the user uses keys to move the 
    tiles. 
    
GameBoard.java - This file contains the GameBoard class which is the 2D array
    of Tile objects in a 4 by 4 array, and contains, most importantly, the
    move and draw functions. The move function is prompted when a key is pushed
    and the draw function is always run through each time a key is pushed. This 
    file also contains the private class Tile which contains the position and value of the tile.
